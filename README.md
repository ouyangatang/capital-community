# capital-community

I was asked to make a website for an organization founded at UT Austin, Capital Community (Austin Microfinance Group). 
It's a community service organization that aims to increase financial literacy in underserved populations in Austin. 

For now, you can view the site (in progress) at https://ouyangatang.github.io/capital-community. 

Once it's done, it will be on the domain (capitalcommunity.us)
