# capital-community

I was asked to make a website for an organization founded at UT Austin, Capital Community (Austin Microfinance Group). 
It's a community service organization that aims to increase financial literacy in underserved populations in Austin. 

It's now connected to the domain! You can see it at http://capitalcommunity.us
